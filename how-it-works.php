			  	<h4>Extra incentive to give your Personal Causes</h4>
				<p>Giving is Living isn’t a normal fundraising 
site. When someone buys a deal, they can 
choose for these funds to be donated to 
your Personal Causes. They get a deal and raise 
much needed funds at the same time!</p>
			<h4>Your Personal Causes’s own Giving is Living page </h4>
			<p>When you register your Personal Causes you will be 
given your own page from which you can:</p>

<ul>
<li>set up multiple fundraisers</li> 
<li>post news and updates</li>
<li>track how much you’ve raised</li> 
<li>see businesses with deals in the area</li>
<li>see the top 3 businesses raising money   
    for your Personal Causes from purchased deals.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Set up multiple fundraising campaigns</h4>
<p>Your page acts as a general Personal Causes fund, 
which can be donated to through deals or 
by a straight donation. However, you can 
also set up individual fundraisers linked to 
your Personal Causes to achieve a funding goal for 
a specific purpose.</p>
			  </div>
			  
			  <div class="one-third">
			<h4>It’s easy to promote your page</h4>
			<p>Once your Personal Causes page is set up, promote 
your page and fundraisers through social 
media or use the PDF in the marketing 
material section of your page as a 
handout.</p>
			<h4>It’s <span class="red-text">FREE</span> to register </h4>
<p>Submit your Personal Causes’s details for approval 
and we will set up the page so you can 
start raising funds</p>

			<h4><span class="red-text">2011</span> Greg the pizza man, meets Wayne the homeless guy</h4>
			
			<p>Greg, a pizza man, was approached by a homeless man, Wayne, begging for money. He gave him a few coins to 
move him on, but he turned up begging the very next day. Greg asked what the money was for and Wayne replied, 
"just for food mate." Greg decided to make him a free pizza, gave him a drink and went back to work. 
As Greg was working in the back kitchen, he heard coins jingling and assuming the worst, ran out expecting to 
catch the homeless man stealing his tips. To his surprise, Wayne was emptying the entire contents of his tiny purse 
into Greg's tip jar. It wasn't much, but it was everything he had.</p>

			<h4>Wayne, the Biggest Giver</h4>
			
			<p>After Wayne’s act of total giving and appreciation, Greg aways referred to him as ‘The Biggest Giver.’ From that 
special moment, Greg made the decision that anytime Wayne showed up, he would give him his favourite pizza 
and drink for free. Wayne  continued to drop his few coins into Greg's tip jar, this bothered Greg, but Wayne really 
wanted to give back any way he could as a thank you for Greg’s generosity.</p>

			<h4>The Power of Giving</h4>
			
			<p>It was during one of Wayne's visits that Jasmine, a friend’s 11 year old autistic daughter, suggested Wayne go out 
and offer little gift hearts as a donation, instead of begging. Jasmine had just spent six months successfully giving 
the hearts to the local homeless to sell as an alternative to begging.  Jasmine's idea inspired Greg so much, that he 
immediately bought 200 hearts from her and encouraged Wayne to sell the heart's to earn some money.</p>

			<h4><span class="red-text">2012</span> The Business of Giving</h4>
			
			<p>After 2 years of friendship, Wayne sadly passed away. It was during this time that the idea of Giving is Living was 
birthed. Wayne's acts of generosity had begun a change in Greg's personal and business life, so in honour of 
Wayne’s memory, he gave away thousands of pizzas, as vouchers, to support his local community.</p>

			<p>Greg gave the pizza vouchers away for free so community groups (schools, clubs and other local organisations) 
could sell them, with every cent raised going towards their much needed projects. Greg saw this simply as a way to 
support his local community. When he was asked how he could afford to do this, with a twinkle in his eye, he would 
always reply, 
<stron>"if you ain't giving, you ain't living."</strong></p>

			<h4><span class="red-text">2013</span> The first business to get on board</h4>
			
			<p>Goran and Frosa, friends of Greg, owned a pizza shop on the other side of town. They had heard about the success 
of Giving is Living in Greg’s community and were keen to implement it into their business. Not long after giving out 
their free pizza vouchers for community groups to sell, they too experienced the goodwill of the program and saw 
firsthand how it benefited their community and business. </p>

			<h4><span class="red-text">2015</span> More businesses on board</h4>
			
			<p>Encouraged by the success of Greg's pizza business, a direct result of the power of giving, other businesses chose 
to support their local community and offered their products and services using Greg's now popular Giving is Living 
voucher system. They saw the benefits were not just to themselves, but to the deal purchaser (who gets a great 
deal) and the community, which raises much needed funds - everyone benefits.</p>

			<h4><span class="red-text">2016</span> Giving is Living goes online</h4>
			
			<p>The above events inspired the creation of the Giving is Living website. The goal is to build stronger relationships 
between business and community Australia wide. Just like it used to be years ago when everyone knew their local 
shop owner, if someone was in need, the community rallied together to help them out. 
The Giving is Living business model means everyone benefits, both economically and socially. The more people on 
board, the more we can all make a difference. </p>
